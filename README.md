# Rules: 
There are few variations of Othello. This script is based on the rules found here: [Mattel Othello Instructions](https:service.mattel.com/instruction_sheets/T8130-Eng.pdf)

## Objective
End the game with more disks on the board than your opponent

## How to move
- A move inovlves placing your piece in a space that will outflank your opponent's pieces 
- Outflank means to place a disk on the board so that a row of your opponent's disk(s) are sandwiched between two disks of your color 
- Outflanking can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal
- Disks can only be outflanked as a direct result of a move and must fall in direct line of the disk that was placed 

## Gameplay
- Black moves first 
- Pass turn to your opponent if you cannot make a legal move 
- You cannot move disks that have already been placed 
- Game ends when neither player can make a move 
- Winner is the one with the most disks
